README

"lea_streamlit_example.py" is my contribution to a TechLabs project (full project here: https://github.com/lbeiermann/The-Muggle-Sorting-Hat).
It's a prototype of an app that allows teachers to form diverse classes of students, while making sure that friends who want to be in the
same class, stay together.
